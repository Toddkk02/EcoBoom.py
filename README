This software I created using Python (the Tkinter library) 
is my first software development project. It allows you to keep track of your finances, including incoming and outgoing transactions
, a graphical representation of your balance, and a financial goal. Unfortunately, for now, the program is only available in Italian, but in the upcoming versions,
I will work on implementing a language setting and many other features for international users. Sending you a hug from Todd!
